\arguments{
\item{dd}{A matrix of DNA methylation with informative regions on rows and samples on columns}

\item{atlas_tc}{A data.frame with previously computed tumor content estimation for each sample}

\item{ref_mat}{A matrix with mean and sd DNA methylation for each cell-type of interest and each region}

\item{atlas_samples}{List of samples for which the TC should be considered 1 regardless of the estimation}

\item{cfdna_ids}{List of samples for which healthy cfDNA should be used as background, instead of PBMCs (default)}

\item{mode}{Deconvolution strategy used, default to brms Bayesian regression (Stan backend)}

\item{sequential}{execute the computation sequentially (for debugging purpose)}

\item{nclust}{Number of cluster for parallel computation}
}

A data.frame with PE score
}
